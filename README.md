## 🤖 AI Agents Workflow & Architecture

The system deploys a crew of 3 specialized autonomous agents that work collaboratively:

1. **Social Media Trend Researcher:** Scans and extracts the top 5 latest trends and insights regarding the specified technical topic.
2. **LinkedIn Content Creator:** Takes the researched trends and crafts an engaging, emoji-rich professional post under 300 words with a strong hook and clear Call-to-Action (CTA).
3. **Hashtag & SEO Specialist:** Analyzes the final draft and generates 10 optimized, high-reach hashtags to maximize visibility on the LinkedIn algorithm.
